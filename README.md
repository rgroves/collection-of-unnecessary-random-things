# Robert Groves' Collection of Unnecessary Random Things

Welcome! I'm Robert, the jester of this here COURT. Feel free to explore the random-randomness within, however keep in mind that I cannot provide refunds for any time ~~wasted~~ spent exploring here. You see, well, it's a long story really, but the short of it is that the higher-ups got really upset the last time I issued a time refund; so there will be no more of that. It was a bureaucratic nightmare.

As of the exact moment you are reading this, (barring any instances of me forgetting to update the READMEâ€”which, let's face it, is highly probable), there is a misnomer in the title of this repo considering there is only one thing here at the moment. Fear not! I am fully confident in my ability to create other unnecessary random things which will accumulate here over time. So feel free to "Star" it, "Watch" it, send feedback, create an issue with an invitation to your COURT, or you know... don't. Whatever tickles your pickle.
