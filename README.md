# Robert Groves' Collection of Unnecessary Random Things

Welcome! I'm Robert, the jester of this here COURT. Feel free to explore the random-randomness within, however keep in mind that I cannot provide refunds for any time ~~wasted~~ spent exploring here. You see, well, it's a long story really, but the short of it is that the higher-ups got really upset the last time I issued a time refund; so there will be no more of that. It was a bureaucratic nightmare.

If you've been keeping track (let's face it, no one has), we've gone from one unnecessary thing to [drum roll...] **two unnecessary things**. Two is not one, but it also is not many. Fear not! I am fully confident in my ability to create other unnecessary random things which will accumulate here over time. So feel free to "Star" it, "Watch" it, send feedback, create an issue with an invitation to your COURT, or you know... don't. Whatever tickles your pickle.
