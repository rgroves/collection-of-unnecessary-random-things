# FoggyDrone

This is an add-on/hack for [FOGGY.Golf](https://foggy.golf/) ([created by Reactvts](https://reactvts.com/)) which allows you to deploy a "simulated Drone" with Fog-Peeking Hole Detection and Lasing Capabilities For Foggy Golfers.

This was "hey, I noticed this game exposes the entire game state locally (i.e. not just what the player can/should be able to see), let's see if I can use that to create a hint for where the hole is located for each daily puzzle" project. Given that, it may very well no longer be able to work sometime in the future if/when state that should be unknown to the player is kept only on the server-side. Until then, I'll try to keep this updated. Enjoy!

Copy & Paste [this code](foggy-drone.js) into your DevTools Console Window (üòÖ "What, me worry?")

A new button will be added to the club options section: üëÅÔ∏è

- 1st click activates drone and performs a Level 3 Scan which lases a wide area hint
- 2nd click activates drone and performs a Level 2 Scan which lases a narrow area hint
- 3rd click activates drone and performs a Level 1 Scan which lases the exact location of hole

The drone does not reveal any tree, water, bunker obstacles (because that would suck all the fun out of it... you know, instead of just sucking a little fun out of it).

Happy Golfing!
